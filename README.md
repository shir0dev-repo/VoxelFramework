# VoxelFramework
 
<p>
    <b>Voxel Framework</b> is a project designed to be an all-around answer to the
    lack of voxelized game engines. It should be noted that as it is created
    with OpenGL (using the Lightweight Java Game Library), the render process
    is not technically a voxel renderer, but a mesh renderer set up to handle
    voxel data in a 3D world.

<p>
    With <b>Voxel Framework</b>, the plan is to design a sort of "pick-up and go" type 
    engine, where one could download the base engine, and just add their own
    functionality, without having to worry about the memory optimizations and 
    conventions of OpenGL usage. With this in mind, there are plans for a ton of
    utility classes and methods designed for optimization, and control over the 
    low-level code, without actually requiring the end user to implement them. 
    They serve as a bonus, for anyone that could think of and implement an 
    improved framework.

    This project stems from an early found love of Voxel-based games, such as Minecraft.
    Terraria, and others. In my early years of development it was my dream to create a 
    game that was similar in world design, but with more purpose. Upon attempting these
    various (and inevitably forfeited) projects, I came to realize there was no engine 
    on the market that could properly do what I had in mind, and so this project came to
    fruition.
